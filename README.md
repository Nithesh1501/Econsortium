The main aim of the project “E-Governance and Prediction of Consortia Resource” is to maintain
and manage, predict, analyze all the consumable resources within a Consortium which is governed
by a super administrator. This is an online web application system which has user authentication,
and an analysis of data can be done by using the historical datasets of the consortium. The user can
also download the data history and can analyze the data, predict the flow of resources within an
organization. This project also includes a reorder alert system for ensuring the availability of
resources.
